Expected output:

A melodic electronic composition with classical influences, featuring a string ensemble, trumpet, brass section, synth strings, and drums. Set in F# minor with a 4/4 time signature, it moves at an Allegro tempo. The mood evokes a cinematic, spacious, and epic atmosphere while maintaining a sense of relaxation. Slow (relaxed).


A classical piece that could be part of a film soundtrack, this composition is a soothing blend of acoustic guitar, flute, clarinet, oboe, and contrabass. With a tempo of 115 beats per minute, it's set in the key of E minor and maintains a 4/4 time signature throughout. The chord progression of Em, D, Dm, A, and Am adds to its emotional and romantic ambiance, making it an ideal choice for a relaxing listening experience. Moderate (balanced).

A melodic and happy pop song with classical influences, featuring a piano as the sole instrument. Set in the key of G# minor with a 4/4 time signature, it maintains a Moderato tempo throughout. The chord progression of Ebm, B, C#, Ebm, and B recurs frequently, lending a sense of familiarity to the piece. Fast (energetic).
