## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

**Stockgorithm** is a research-driven initiative focused on applying deep learning techniques to stock market analysis and prediction. The project is designed to tackle key challenges faced by retail investorsâ€”such as emotional trading, lack of expertise, and market volatilityâ€”by offering a fully automated AI-powered trading assistant.

Our solution leverages technical indicators like MACD, RSI, and Pivot Points, along with sentiment analysis from financial news to provide a robust and intelligent trading recommendation system. The application integrates deep learning models with real-time data APIs (e.g., Upstox) and executes trades based on predictive analytics and reinforcement learning strategies. A user dashboard provides insights, performance tracking, and alerting mechanisms.
